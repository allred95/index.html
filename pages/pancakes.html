        <ol>2 tablespoons sugar</ol>

        <p><strong>directions</strong></p>
        <ol>Mix the milk and vinegar and let it sit for a minute or two (you’re making “buttermilk” here).</ol>
        <ol>Whisk the dry ingredients together. Whisk the egg, milk, and melted butter into the dry ingredients until just combined.</ol>
        <ol>Heat a nonstick pan over medium heat. Melt a little smear of butter in the pan (essential for giving a yummy golden brown crust).</ol>
        <ol>Pour about 1/3 cup of batter into the hot skillet and spread it flat-like (it will be pretty thick). Arrange a few blueberries on top. Cook until you see little bubbles on top and the edges starting to firm up. Flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes until the pancakes are sky-high fluffy and cooked through.</ol>
        <ol>Serve with butter and maple syrup. But honestly, sometimes I just like to eat these plain. YUM, YUM, YUM.
