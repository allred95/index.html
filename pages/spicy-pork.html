        <p><strong>5 Ingredient Sauce:</strong></p>

           <ol> 2 tablespoons hot chili paste (I like sambal oelek, but sriracha can also work)</ol>
           <ol> 2 tablespoons soy sauce</ol>
            <ol>2 tablespoons brown sugar</ol>
            <ol>1 1-inch piece of ginger, peeled and finely grated</ol>
            <ol>1 garlic clove, finely grated</ol>


            <strong>Other Stuff:</strong>
            
            <p><ol>1 1/2 pounds pork tenderloin, very thinly sliced (see notes)</ol></p>
            <ol>vegetable oil</ol>
            <strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong>
            <p>Shake all the sauce ingredients in a jar. Pour the sauce over the pork and allow it to rest for 20 minutes – 1 hour.
            Heat a good searing skillet (such as cast iron) over high heat. Add just a little bit of vegetable oil.
            When the oil is hot and shiny, add the pork in a single layer (you may need to do this in batches). Cook, undisturbed, for 1-2 minutes until you are getting that nice caramelized look. Flip and repeat to finish.
            That’s it! Serve with rice and veggies (details in notes section) and enjoy your flavortown masterpiece.</p>
            
            <h5>NOTES</h5>
            <strong>Bowl extras:</strong> <p>I like to serve these with rice and sautéed carrots and greens. Just throw the carrots and greens in the pan after the pork is cooked to get all that yummy flavor.</p>

            <p>The real trick here is getting the pan hot enough to cook the meat VERY quickly – you want that golden brown sear, but you don’t want your pork to be sitting in a hot pan for more than just a few minutes because it will start to get tough. We want FAST high heat. To get the thinnest slices of pork, put your pork tenderloin in the freezer for a bit before slicing and use a very sharp knife. This will be a lil splattery. That oil is hot – be careful of your hands and your white shirts. Wear an apron! I also usually need to spend a little time giving my cast iron some TLC after making this. Totally worth it.</p>
